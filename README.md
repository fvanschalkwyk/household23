# General Household Survey 2023
Analysis of the South African General Household Survey for 2023.

This is a repository for me to learn how to use Git, Github and Rmarkdown by having a look at the South African General Household Survey Data for 2023.

I want to have a look at the following data:

- [ ] Access to piped water by population group
- [ ] Education level by population group and province
- [ ] Access to water by population group in- and outside metro
